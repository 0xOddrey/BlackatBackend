Web1,the first iteration of the web; commonly referred to as the “read-only web.” Web1 was characterized by static websites that displayed information. There was little to no user interaction or user-generated content
Web2,starting in the 90s; the “read-write web” is characterized by user-generated content and improved user interfaces. This led to the creation of blogs and social media platforms; as well as sites like Wikipedia and YouTube. Web2 placed more emphasis on user experience and interoperability between different applications and websites; giving us the vast network of connected websites and resources that we are familiar with today
Web3,the next iteration of the web being ushered in as we speak; which leverages blockchain technology; open-source applications; and the decentralization of data and information.
